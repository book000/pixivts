# pixivts

[pixiv](https://www.pixiv.net/) Unofficial API Library for TypeScript

This is NOT a fork of [@ibaraki-douji/pixivts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ibaraki-douji/pixivts). However, I do use it as a reference.

## ðŸš€ Install

This library is available at npm: [@book000/pixivts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@book000/pixivts)

If you are using npm:

```shell
npm install @book000/pixivts
```

or if you are using yarn:

```shell
yarn add @book000/pixivts
```

## âœ¨ Features

- It mainly uses the private API that the iOS pixiv app communicates with. Inspired by [pixivpy](https://github.com/upbit/pixivpy).
- All API request methods return an [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) response.
  This allows this library users to use all responses, without having to wait for library updates if the API response changes.

## ðŸ“š API Document

The API documentation for this library is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be found [here](https://book000.github.io/pixivts/).  
Please note that many of the comments in the document are written in Japanese!
